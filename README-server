READ THIS
---------

This was originally a readme for the libwebsockets test server by Andy Green.
Since we basically took the test server and only altered it slightly into a
kurve server, most instructions below should still work.

Always run the server from the server directory, or the server will not be able
to find the client files.

Please note that the whole build-process has only been somewhat rigerously
tested on a 64bit Ubuntu machine and a 32bit Debian machine. We have been able
to compile and run the server on Windows 7 and a ARM machine, though. The 
windows build is not without challenges (mostly getting pthreads working)
The libwebsockets project is quite portable and actually has some win32 code,
which we did not include here. It should be possible to get the server running
on most systems with some effort (and/ or expertise) 

The rest of this file is copied from the libwebsockets project. Stuff like 
custom configs and SSL we have never tried. It might work, but don't expect it
to :-P


Using test-server as a quickstart
---------------------------------

For a Fedora x86_86 box, the following config line was
needed:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib64 --enable-openssl

For Apple systems, Christopher Baker reported that this is needed
(and I was told separately enabling openssl makes trouble somehow)

./configure CC="gcc -arch i386 -arch x86_64" CXX="g++ -arch i386 -arch
x86_64" CPP="gcc -E" CXXCPP="g++ -E" --enable-nofork

For mingw build, I did the following to get working build, ping test is
disabled when building this way

1) install mingw64_w32 compiler packages from Fedora
2) additionally install mingw64-zlib package
3) ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-mingw --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32
4) make

otherwise if /usr/local/... and /usr/local/lib are OK then...

$ ./configure
$ make clean
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ cd server
$ ./kurveserver

should be enough to get a server listening on port 7861.

There are a couple of other possible configure options

--enable-nofork		disables the fork into the background API
			and removes all references to fork() and
			pr_ctl() from the sources.  Use it if your
			platform doesn't support forking.

--enable-libcrypto	by default libwebsockets uses its own
			built-in md5 and sha-1 implementation for
			simplicity.  However the libcrypto ones
			may be faster, and in a distro context it
			may be highly desirable to use a common
			library implementation for ease of security
			upgrades.  Give this configure option
			to disable the built-in ones and force use
			of the libcrypto (part of openssl) ones.

--with-client-cert-dir=dir   tells the client ssl support where to
			     look for trust certificates to validate
			     the remote certificate against.
			
--enable-x-google-mux   Enable experimental x-google-mux support
                        in the build (see notes later in document)
